# porcupine

This is intended to be a safe Rust wrapper around the Win32 API, with an emphasis on the graphical WinUser part of the API. In terms of totality of coverage of the Windows API, it is very incomplete. It will likely remain in this state for a long time; the main reason I'm developing this is to make GUI development in Windows easier.
